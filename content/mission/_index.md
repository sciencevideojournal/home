# DIRECT: Science Video Platform

+ `DIRECT`: **D**irect **I**nnovation & **R**esearch to **E**ngage **C**ommuniies **T**oday

## Mission Statement

Two critical problems in society motivate the formation of this zine. 

**First** there is a growing disconnect between science {are we trying to more broadly reach non-scientific academics e.g. filthy English profs} and society, driven by increasingly complex science that is [picked/pulled/action verb] apart by 
misinformation campaigns and culture wars ... 

...but also by the fundamental disconnect between how scientists publish our work and how
people engage with new information. 

This brings up the **second** problem: scientific publishing is broken [af, CITATION NEEDED]. 

The core ideas that created modern scientific publishing remain critical to [advancing knowledge/furthering society]: peer-review, a continuously updating scientific knowledge base, and common grounds for idea-exchanges. 

However, scientific publishing faces a number of challenges including: 
predatory journals, lack of reviewer compensation,
unacceptably long review times,
and expensive open-access publishing. Ultimately, this all incentivizes publishing "Minimum Publishable Units"" to maximize citation counts and publications.

[Need to critique the current "form" of publishing i.e. textual articles in static journals e.g. Matt's dope talk "Beyond the PDF"]

Some of these problems are being addressed. Most notably with the explosion of pre-print servers, [which addresses many of the needs for more easily communicating information to _other scientists_ but does little to connect findings to the broader society]. 

We believe a video [platform/ledger/fake-word] can fix all this garbo. One aimed at publishing cutting-edge science that can be understood by anyone will address the some of the core brokenness in academic publishing. [One not constrained by a single type of media.] 

More importantly, we think it can address a critical gap between science and society by connecting more people to our work and to us.  

## What a video platform can do

+ Supplement the archaic scientific publication machine with a modern alternative.
+ Provide an opportunity for scientists to communicate their work to a larger and broader audience.
+ Overcome barriers to effective science communication: paywalls, exorbitant publishing fees, painfully dry and convoluted science prose. 
+ Compensate reviewers for their work. 
+ Increase equity in access to scientific progress

## How this will work

+ Scientists, either on their own or collaborating with creative artists, will make stand-alone videos of their research.
+ These videos, their transcripts, and datasets and code used to make them will be sent out to other scientists for peer-review.
+ Peer-reviewers will suggest scientific and stylistic advice (guided by our best practices). All reviews will be signed and open to the public.
+ If video reviews well and reviewers suggest accepting, we will publish the video on our YouTube channel and website.
+ Revenue from advertisements on the channel will be split as follows: 50% to the author, 10% to the reviewers, and 40% to us. 
+ We will use our portion of revenue to grow the channel visibility, target collaborations with the large education focused YouTube channels, and generally work to connect more people to the science on our journal.


## The Katy Plan
1. Target 5 people who will make beta videos [(i.e. kind of blah or whatevs. no big deal its chill)]
2. Launch with these 5-7 videos and then iterate based on feedback
3. Fully launch after a "soft opening"
4. Repeat steps 1-3 [4ever]
