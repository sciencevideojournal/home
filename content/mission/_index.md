Mission

-Understanding systems and why people behave in a way that maintains the status quo
	-Requires understanding how to leverage points in a system
	-Gig economy and gig workers who are isolated and have very little leverage as individuals, but would have a lot of power if organized
	-Need an anonymous for workers/professors who dissent from the system

-How much value do we generate from our work as individual professors?
	-Some may think ”None”, but publishing companies make billions of dollars off of knowledge work
-How little power professors have in the academia and universities, nearly all of universities wanted to open up during COVID despite most professors not wanting to

-How can you remove the value from your work in a way that prevents companies or outside entities from hoarding the value privately
	-open source code and methods
	-Tapxi app in Colombia -- an app that connects all of the taxi drivers so that there isn’t an Uber type organization leaching value from other people’s work
		-Narrowly focused connective tissue for Taxi drivers
	-Example: Epic games vs. Apple store , apple marks up cost of apps by 30% (not the actual cost of running an app store)
